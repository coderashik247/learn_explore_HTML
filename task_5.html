        <h3>How I Built My First Portfolio Website</h3>
        <p>Ashikur Ashik | June 28, 2025</p>
        <p>
            I recently completed my first portfolio website using HTML and CSS, and the experience was amazing. At
            first, I was nervous, but once I started breaking the site into sections, it felt manageable. I began with a
            simple layout: header, about me, projects, and contact.
        </p>

        <p>
            I used a clean font from Google Fonts and added icons with Font Awesome to give the site a modern look. I
            made sure the website looked good on both desktop and mobile using basic responsive design.
        </p>

        <p>
            Publishing it with GitHub Pages was surprisingly easy. I just uploaded my code to a GitHub repo and enabled
            Pages from the settings. Now itâ€™s live and I can share it with others!

        <h3>Top 5 Beginner Mistakes in HTML</h3>
        <p>Ashikur Ashik | July 1, 2025</p>
        <p>
            When you're learning HTML, it's common to make small mistakes that can break your layout or make your code
            messy. The good news is â€” these are easy to fix once you know what to watch out for.
        </p>

        <p>
            A big mistake is forgetting to close tags. Always make sure every <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> has a closing tag. Another issue is using tags
            incorrectly â€” like placing a block element inside an inline tag.
        </p>

        <p>
            To avoid these errors, use proper indentation, validate your HTML, and test your code often. Over time,
            writing clean and correct HTML becomes a habit!
